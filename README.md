# Varius_project
A time keeping portal for client projects using Django 




 AUG 2019
 
 After some review the time keeper site has been changed to help with our time keeping. 
This email explains these changes. 

-----------------------------
	filter
-----------------------------
The admin-level filter has been extended to all users so that individuals will be able to quickly review their own time entries. Upon selecting the [Filter results] box in the home page, the user will be taken to a selection page where any(or all) of the fields may be selected. 
If a user would like to select all of the entries from a specific project between Sep 1 and 15, this can be done by filling the client, project and dates field - 
The info is then filtered and redisplayed on the home page- 

For your convenience, the sums for hours, expenses, and miles will be displayed along with the selected timeframe

-----------------------------
	new fields 
-----------------------------
New entries have been added to the database for expenses and for miles along with corresponding note fields - Though it adds a bit of complexity to the data entry to have 3 separate note fields, it will help immensely with being able to pull the proper notes for billing. 
Please note, none of the time, expense, miles or their notes have been made mandatory by the form, so making an entry without expense or miles will take no additional steps. 


--------------------------------------
	staff-level overview
--------------------------------------
Project Managers will be able to view all the entries for all times, expenses, and miles on a specific project by selecting the overview tab on the menu bar. 
This allows the PM to be able to better estimate a project's budget at a glance.  Though the PM is able to view the times posted, staff-level overview does not allow the PM to make any changes to the posted entry.
